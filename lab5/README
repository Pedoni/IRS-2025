LAB 5: SWARM ROBOTICS

Exercise 1

This last exercise was quite guided, so I started by setting all the suggested values ​​in constants and defining the CountRAB function. Then I decided to define two states (RANDWALK and STOP), thus keeping variables for the current state and the next state. I then took the functions for the random walk (as explained in class, not an optimal version) and the obstacle avoidance from the previous exercises. Using these mechanisms, I defined two main functions:
- Randwalk(), which takes care of doing random walks with obstacle avoidance, and each time calculates the probability of stopping and possibly stops the robot (changing state)
- Stop(), which takes care of stopping the robot and each time calculates the probability of restarting and possibly restarts the robot (changing state)

Exercise 2

At this point I simply added the two required variables, thus updating the probability calculation also taking into account the presence or absence of a spot. From the tests, a correct trend actually emerges: robots tend to stop more likely when they are in a group on a spot.
